# PIC32CM_USART

- Mini project using USART peripheral on the PIC32CM MC Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit board with the PIC32CM1216MC00032 microcontroller.

- Environment:
  - IDE: MPLAB X 6.05
  - Framework: Harmony 3


- Aplicação:
  - This project uses the LED and the button available on the board itself. When the button is pressed, the LED changes its state, and a message is sent over the serial interface (SERCOM1) to the connected device.
